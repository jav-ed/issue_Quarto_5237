# Inp - Trial - 2

when talking about found --> refer to cross-referencing
this part here is loaded as a **PART** qmd file

Further check [@sec-chap_1_Intro_Trial_2] -- is not found
chapter [-@sec-chap_1_Abc_Trial_2] -- is found


We see multiple things here
1) A qmd file is set as part file
2) First the introduction is loaded, it contains the references, i.e., the id definitions for the chapters
3) The qmd file that invokes the reference using [@name_Of_Reference] comes in the chapter (after part) section in the yml file
4) Strangely, the first chapter defined in the intro.qmd file fill not be found. However, the second chapter defined in the intro.qmd fill be found for cross-ref.
